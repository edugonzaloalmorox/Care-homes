\begin{abstract}
This study investigates the effects of house prices in the English care homes market. 
High house prices, as experienced currently in England, may disincentive the entry in
 certain markets restricting the access to long term care services in these areas. Alternatively, 
 these areas may also suppose business opportunity. We provide evidence in order to disentangle 
 these effects. Our results suggest that higher house prices increase the rate care homes. 
 Based on unique dataset that collates information from several sources our analysis exploits 
 planning regulations to address empirical limitations associated with the house prices. Our findings
  contribute to inform policy makers about the relationship between the long term care and housing markets.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec: intro}

England has experienced the fastest growth in house prices amongst all OECD country during the last decades.
This inflationary trend has had consequences for both households, materialised in the so called “house affordability crisis”, 
and to less extent businesses. In this paper we investigate the relationship between the house prices 
and the market structure of an industry that typically operates with low margins, the care homes 
that provide long term care services. Our interest in the long term care is not trivial. Elements such as 
the ageing of the population or some socioeconomic changes that include the inclusion of more women 
in the labour force as well as the composition of different family structures, have shifted informal caregiving 
towards more formal long term care provision. These patterns evidence the importance of this sector in the 
forthcoming decades. Yet, despite the will of policy makers to design policies that preserve a sustainable 
provision of long term care and that also ensure competitive market structures, there is limited evidence for
 the design of these policies.  We aim at informing these policies by analysing the extent of the effect of high 
 prices in the housing market on the entries in the market of care homes.
